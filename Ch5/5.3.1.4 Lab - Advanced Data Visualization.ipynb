    "In this lab, you will learn how to combine an `SQLite` database, `JSON` files, and `pandas` `DataFrame`s. You will interface with a wrapper for the library `folium`, that enables you to plot data on a geographical map. You will produce a map of the United Kingdom divided in areas, each colored in a shade that is proportional to the internet speed, a very powerful way of understanding the data. With such a map, it will be very clear how internet speed vaires across England. You will learn how to find and fix problems in the data. \n",
