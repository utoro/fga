    "### Scenario/Background\n",
    "* In the first part of this lab, you will learn how to answer questions in a scientific way, with data. You will use descriptive statistics and plots to determine the Internet speed and visualize the results. Your analysis will be carried out using Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib. \n",

    "* In the second part of this lab, you will learn how to report quantitative findings, and how to support conclusions in a scientific way. You will illustrate your results with plots, making sure that these are as clear and insightful as possible. You will generate professional-looking graphs by means of the Seaborn library, or other styles such as FiveThirtyEight.\n",
